# MEAPI

MEAPI is an Objective-C wrapper for [My Eyuboglu](http://my.eyuboglu.com), using the reverse engineered API endpoints.
[My Eyuboglu](http://my.eyuboglu.com) is the school portal for Eyuboglu, my former school. I hated their app, so...

## Usage

MEAPI utilizes the singleton pattern.

**Initialization**

```objective-c
+(instancetype)sharedInstance;

[MEAPI sharedInstance]
        // Returns a MEAPI instance
```

**Obtaining session token**

A session token must be existent for the following methods to work.

```objective-c
-(void)getSessionTokenWithCompletionBlock:(MEAPISessionTokenCompletionBlock)completionBlock;

[[MEAPI sharedInstance] getSessionTokenWithCompletionBlock:^(NSString *sessionToken) {
        /*
                sessionToken:
                        @"abcdefghijklm"
                
                Session token is stored automatically, the completion block is provided for convenience.
        */
}];
```

**Fetch newest school news**

```objective-c
-(void)getNewsWithCompletionBlock:(MEAPINewsCompletionBlock)completionBlock;

[[MEAPI sharedInstance] getNewsWithCompletionBlock:^(NSArray *news, NSError *error) {
        /*
                news:
                        MENews
                        MENews
                        MENews
                        ...
                        
                error:
                        Generic NSError object filled up if an error occurs.
        */
}];
```

**Fetch school names list**

```objective-c
-(void)getSchoolListWithCompletionBlock:(MEAPISchoolListCompletionBlock)completionBlock;

[[MEAPI sharedInstance] getSchoolListWithCompletionBlock:^(NSArray *schools, NSError *error) {
        /*
                schools:
                        MESchool
                        MESchool
                        MESchool
                        ...
                        
                error:
                        Generic NSError object filled up if an error occurs.
        */
}];
```

**Fetching detail for a news object**

```objective-c
-(void)getDetailForNews:(MENews *)news completionBlock:(MEAPINewsDetailCompletionBlock)completionBlock;

[[MEAPI sharedInstance] getDetailForNews:(MENews *)news
                        completionBlock:^(MENews *news, NSError *error) {
        /*
                news:
                        The news object provided to the method, filled up with additional information. Check MENews.h.
                        
                error:
                        Generic NSError object filled up if an error occurs.
        */
}];
```

**Auto login with saved credentials**

```objective-c
-(void)autologinWithCompletionBlock:(MEAPIAutoLoginCompletionBlock)completionBlock;

[[MEAPI sharedInstance] autologinWithCompletionBlock:^(MEStudent *student, NSError *error) {
        /*
                student:
                        Logged in student.
                        
                error:
                        Generic NSError object filled up if an error occurs.
        */
}];
```

**Login with credentials**

```objective-c
-(void)loginWithSchoolNumber:(NSString *)schoolNumber password:(NSString *)password schoolCode:(NSString *)schoolCode withCompletionBlock:(MEAPILoginCompletionBlock)completionBlock;

[[MEAPI sharedInstance] loginWithSchoolNumber:@"100"
                        password:@"dummy"
                        schoolCode:@"dummy"
                        withCompletionBlock:^(MEStudent *student, NSError *error) {
                                 /*
                                        student:
                                                Logged in student.
                        
                                        error:
                                                Generic NSError object filled up if an error occurs.
                                                
                                        Credentials are saved upon login. Check -autologinWithCompletionBlock:
                                */
}];
```

**Logout**

```objective-c
-(void)logout;

[[MEAPI sharedInstance] logout];

/* 
        Clears the session token & resets saved credentials 
*/
```

**Get card**

```objective-c
-(void)getCurrentCardWithType:(MEAPICardType)type completionBlock:(MEAPICardCompletionBlock)completionBlock;

[[MEAPI sharedInstance] getCurrentCardWithType:MEAPICardTypeOfficial
                        completionBlock:^(MECard *card, NSError *error) {
                                 /*
                                        card:
                                                Fetched card.
